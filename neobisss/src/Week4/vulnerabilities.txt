1.  Added Spring Security
    Impact: It improves the overall security of the project
            by requiring authentication before accessing the resources

2.  Implemented Password Encoding
    Impact: Avoids exposure of passwords in requests

3.  Application.properties deleted using bfg cleaner
    Impact: history of the commits doesn't contain sensitive data: password of the local server
            But it contains application.properties in the last commits
            The main purpose of deleting was a practice with ```bfg```
